the database currently holds about 1700 TIGR radiosonds with name TIGRXXXX where XXXX can be 0001-1700ish.

The user interface is pretty brittle right now. It is mostly a proof of concept.

Tests:
there is a file to test the results of PyTran against results obtained from RADTRAN on various frequencies from 1.4 GHZ to 400 GHZ.
To run:
$ python3 ray_test_coefficients.py

it should print a bunch of numbers and then give a time for the test run followed by 'OK' if the test was successful.
